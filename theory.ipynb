        "Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be modified after it is created. In Python, objects are classified as either mutable or immutable based on their ability to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mutable Objects\n",
        "Mutable objects can have their content changed after they are created.\n",
        "Examples: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and user-defined objects.\n",
        "These objects allow modifications like adding, removing, or changing elements without creating a new object.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Mutable example: List\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "print(id(my_list))  # Memory address before modification\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list.append(4)  # Modify the list\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "print(id(my_list))  # Memory address remains the same\n",
        "2. Immutable Objects\n",
        "Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created. Any modification results in the creation of a new object.\n",
        "Examples: Tuples, strings, integers, floats, and frozensets.\n",
        "Operations on immutable objects always produce a new object, leaving the original unchanged.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutable example: String\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "print(id(my_string))  # Memory address before modification\n",
        "\n",
        "my_string = my_string + \" world\"  # Create a new string\n",
        "print(my_string)  # Output: \"hello world\"\n",
        "print(id(my_string))  # Memory address changes, because a new object is created\n",
        "Why is Mutability Important?\n",
        "Performance: Mutable objects can be modified in place, saving time and memory, especially for large collections.\n",
        "Design Choice: Choosing mutable or immutable types depends on the need for data integrity and performance:\n",
        "Immutable objects are typically used for fixed, safe data that shouldn’t change, like constants or hashable objects (e.g., tuples used as dictionary keys).\n",
        "Mutable objects are used when you need to modify the data, like adding or removing elements in a list.\n",
        "Key Takeaways\n",
        "Mutable: Can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
        "Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation; modifying them creates a new object (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
        "Performance: Mutability affects both memory usage and processing efficiency, so choose the right type for the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6)  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "The difference in mutability between lists and tuples in Python is rooted in their design purposes and use cases. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Purpose of Lists and Tuples\n",
        "Lists are designed for dynamic collections. They are mutable to allow modifications, such as adding, removing, or changing elements. Lists are commonly used when the contents of the collection need to change over time, such as managing a to-do list, modifying a collection of user data, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples, on the other hand, are designed to represent fixed collections. They are immutable because their contents should not change once they are created. This immutability makes tuples useful for representing fixed data structures like coordinates, RGB color values, or other data that should remain constant throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Memory Management and Efficiency\n",
        "Mutable Objects (Lists): Lists can be resized dynamically, which requires additional memory management overhead to handle resizing and modifying the structure.\n",
        "Since lists are mutable, Python allows them to grow or shrink dynamically, with internal structures that support these changes efficiently.\n",
        "Immutable Objects (Tuples): Because tuples cannot be modified, they are simpler and require less memory overhead. The memory layout of tuples is more optimized and fixed, allowing for more efficient storage and access.\n",
        "Immutability allows Python to make some optimizations with tuples, like using shared references to identical objects. This makes them more memory efficient, especially when they are used in large quantities or as dictionary keys.\n",
        "3. Safety and Integrity\n",
        "Immutability (Tuples): Since tuples cannot be changed, they are safer for representing data that should not be altered accidentally. For example, tuples are often used to represent data that should remain constant, like configuration settings or pairs of coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutability also makes tuples hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, whereas mutable objects like lists cannot.\n",
        "4. Use Cases\n",
        "Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are used when you need a collection of items that may change over time. For example:\n",
        "A list of user inputs.\n",
        "A list of items in a shopping cart that users can modify.\n",
        "A dynamic list where items are frequently added or removed.\n",
        "Tuples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are used when you need a collection of items that should not change. For example:\n",
        "Representing fixed data like coordinates (x, y).\n",
        "Storing values that should remain constant throughout the program.\n",
        "Using tuples as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
        "5. Implementation Details\n",
        "Lists: Internally, lists are implemented using dynamic arrays that allow for resizing, which is why they are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are implemented using fixed-size arrays in memory. The fact that their size and contents cannot change allows Python to optimize them for memory efficiency and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Python's Design Philosophy\n",
        "Python follows the principle of “explicit is better than implicit” and “simple is better than complex”. Lists are mutable to make them more flexible for a wider range of tasks, while tuples are immutable to make them safer, more predictable, and easier to optimize.\n",
        "Summary\n",
        "Lists are mutable because they are designed for dynamic, changeable collections of items.\n",
        "Tuples are immutable because they represent fixed, constant data and are designed for efficiency, safety, and use as keys in hash-based collections like dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "In Python, the == and is operators are both used to compare objects, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "Purpose: Compares the values of two objects to see if they are equal.\n",
        "Behavior: Checks if the objects have the same value, but they may be different objects in memory.\n",
        "Common Use: Used when you want to compare the data/content of objects, not their identities.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True, because the values (contents) of the lists are the same\n",
        "In this case, a and b have the same elements, so a == b returns True, even though they are different objects in memory.\n",
        "2. is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "Purpose: Compares the identity of two objects, checking if they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "Behavior: Returns True if both operands refer to the same object in memory (i.e., they have the same memory address).\n",
        "Common Use: Used to check if two references point to the exact same object, not just if their values are equal.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
